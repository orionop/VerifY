# VerifY - Title Verification System

VerifY is a comprehensive title verification system designed for the Press Registrar General of India (PRGI) to validate new publication titles against approximately 160,000 existing titles in their database. The system employs a multi-dimensional verification approach to ensure uniqueness and compliance with regulatory guidelines.

## ðŸ“‹ Introduction

The VerifY system helps prevent duplicate or confusingly similar publication titles by analyzing submissions across multiple dimensions:

- **Lexical Similarity**: Detects spelling variations and calculates string-based match scores
- **Phonetic Similarity**: Identifies sound-alike titles that may have different spellings
- **Semantic Similarity**: Captures meaning-based similarities using advanced language models
- **Content Rule Checking**: Enforces policy guidelines by detecting disallowed words and title combinations
- **Cross-language Detection**: Identifies similar meanings across different Indian languages

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for full stack deployment)

## ðŸ“– System Architecture

The system employs a layered architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Svelte + Vite application with a clean, minimalist UI
2. **API Layer**: FastAPI backend handling verification requests
3. **Verification Engine**: Multi-dimensional similarity analysis pipeline
4. **Storage Layer**: Elasticsearch and FAISS for efficient title indexing and retrieval
